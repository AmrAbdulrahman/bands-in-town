Create a single-page web application that takes an artist from the user and returns details
about the artist and their events. The aim of the code challenge is to be able to understand
the decisions made in building a web application. Focus on the requirements first and if you
have extra time feel free to add bonus features. In the end we will review your submission in
terms of its readability, architecture and creativity.
